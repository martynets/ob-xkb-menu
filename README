This directory contains the ob-xkb-menu version 1.0.

The ob-xkb-menu is Openbox pipe menu for X keyboard extension (XKB) subsystem.
It checks XKB configuration, lists available keyboard layouts/variants and
switches to the selected one.

Software Requirements
---------------------

This package uses bash specific extensions and requires bash shell version 4+.

Unfortunately no one standard package including X11 XKB utilities
(x11-xkb-utils) offers any tool to get/set current keyboard layout. To handle
this the script utilizes xkblayout-state tool which isn't a part of any standard
packages and must be downloaded and compiled separately. It can be downloaded
from its GitHub repository:

  https://github.com/nonpop/xkblayout-state

Optionally libx11-dev and g++ packages might be needed to compile the
xkblayout-state tool.

The following considerations must be also taken as the software requirements.

A desktop specific keyboard layouts switcher is usually configured in its own
way and its settings do not set up the XKB subsystem. Thus the script does not
reflect such a desktop specific settings.

The packages mentioned below can be used to manage the XKB subsytem. It can be
configured in one of the following ways:
    - system-wide settings of keyboard on the console and in X Window by manual
      editing of /etc/default/keyboard file. See man keyboard
      (keyboard-configuration package).
    - system-wide settings in X configuration files by manual editing or using
      localectl tool. See man xkeyboard-config (xkb-data package).
    - user per session settings set up using setxkbmap tool
      (x11-xkb-utils package). Usually such a command is added to one of user's
      startup or rc files.
The last one tool can also be used to check current configuration:
    setxkbmap -print -verbose 10

Installation
------------

This script is the Openbox pipe menu and needs to be installed as per the
Openbox requirements. It can be copied to any convenient location and reference
to it must be added to Openbox menu file which name and location default to
$HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml. Something similar to the following must be
added:

    <menu id="ob-xkb-menu" label="Keyboard Layout"
        execute="/path/to/script/ob-xkb-menu"
            icon="/path/to/icontheme/apps/16/locale.svg"/>

More information on Openbox menu configuration can be found on its wiki page:

  http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Menus

The xkblayout-state tool must be installed in either $PATH or the same directory
with the script.

Additionally a keybinding can be assigned to this menu in the Openbox rc file.
The file name and location default to $HOME/.config/openbox/rc.xml. Something
similar to the following can be added to the keyboard section of the file:

    <keybind key="C-k">
      <action name="ShowMenu">
        <menu>ob-xkb-menu</menu>
      </action>
    </keybind>

Such a keybinding will serve as the visual keyboard layouts switcher.

More information on Openbox configuration can be found on its wiki page:

  http://openbox.org/wiki/Configuration

Configuration
-------------

The ob-xkb-menu script does not support neither configuration files nor
arguments.

There are a few variables defined at the top of the script which in rare cases
might need modifications:

    - XKBLAYOUT - name of the executable file of the xkblayout-state tool.
    - TICKED and UNTICKED - text strings which prefix the current keyboard
      layout and the rest items of the menu respectively. The current one is
      prefixed by check-mark and tab characters when the rest ones by
      non-breaking space and tab characters.
    - ICON - is commended out by default and may contain fully qualified file
      name of the icon file to represent the current layout. If for some reason
      use of icon is preferred then this variable must be uncommented, properly
      setup and the above mentioned TICKED and UNTICKED variables commented out.
